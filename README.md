# flickr-api-test
A simple project to test the Flickr API

# Initial set up

In order to set the project, you will have to use as base what is in config.conf.example

```
$ cd $FLICKR_TEST_API_HOME/config
$ cp config.ini.example congi.ini
```

Replace your Flickr secret and key (although for the project I'm using just the key)
